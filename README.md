## General Information
Bike sharing is a popular mode of transportation in many cities around the world. In recent years, new bike sharing companies have begun using machine learning to optimize their operations. Machine learning is used to predict demand for bikes at different times and locations, and to optimize the distribution of bikes to meet that demand. This has led to more efficient bike sharing operations, and has made it easier for people to find and use bike sharing services.
